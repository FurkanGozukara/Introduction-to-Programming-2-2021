Ayşe - if you pick collation accent sensitive (AS)
and you search for Ayse, then you will get no results
because it is accent sensitive
if you pick AI (accent insensitive) then Ayse will return Ayşe as well

if you pick your collation as case sensitive (CS) then if you search for ayşe in your database, you will not get result Ayşe

however if you pick your collation as case insensitive (CI), then AYŞE or ayşe will return all cases

if you dont use nchar then you can not save non-ANSI characters such as Ğ

so to be able to store non-ANSI characters, you have to use n version of character in SQL server
